                <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a mechanical engineer and designer, recent graduate, looking to transition my career to specialize
                    and develop with Salesforce. As an engineer, notions of project development, logical implementations of
                    scripts and methodologies were part of my personal and academic development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My main characteristic highlighted during my career was being attentive to the details of the work,
                    as a Technical Contracts Analyst this allowed me to perform effective and detailed inspections of projects.
                    I was able to identify flaws and improvements early in projects, this ensured greater customer satisfaction
                    and reduced costs with rework and purchases in large projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have some extensive knowledge in programming logic and structure taken for self-placed courses, bootcamps
                    for the Salesforce ecosystem, and courses abroad in foreign universities such as C#, C++, Matlab; with recent
                    entrance in the Trailhead platform for studies and certifications.
